# Hello!

`UX/UI Designer and Product Designer`

Driven by curiosity and the belief that the impossible is a matter of opinion, I transitioned my 12+ years of leadership and business vision from the tempered glass industry to the digital universe. My background in Architecture, combined with a specialisation in UX/UI Design and Digital Products, allows me to unite aesthetics and functionality in designing user-centered experiences that deliver real impact. I am now seeking a team where I can apply my creativity, analytical capacity, and global adaptability (honed in Ireland) to exceed user expectations.
